        "options": [
          {"id": "a", "text": "The medial plateau is larger and more concave than the lateral plateau"},
          {"id": "b", "text": "The lateral plateau is larger and more concave than the medial plateau"},
          {"id": "c", "text": "Both plateaus are of equal size and concavity"},

        ],
        "correct_answer": "a",
        "explanation": "The medial tibial plateau is larger and more concave than the lateral plateau, which is smaller and more convex, allowing for greater rotational movement."
